# CCS
Converter Control System for DC/DC Converter Based on STM32 MCU

## Simulink
Converter Control System, further CSS, consists of Simulink-generated code. The basic files are ChargeDuty, DischargeDuty and errorHandler.

### ChargeDuty and DischargeDuty
These algorithms intended for duty cycle calculations for both charge and discharge modes of convertor.

### errorHandler
This algorithm consist of basic logic and designed for current and voltage observing in terms of any errors.
